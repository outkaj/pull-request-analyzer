This script assumes you have set up a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/), as described further in the [GitHub Developer API v3 docs](https://developer.github.com/v3/auth/). Setting up this token will increase the rate limit when accessing the GitHub API. The script also assumes that, given the sensitivity of the token, you have set it up as an environment variable on your system called `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
